# Light-Pilot-for-Blender

Have you ever wanted to place your lights intuitively in the viewport without having to guess or go through object constraint? Here is the answer to all these. 
I created this addon as a way to replicate the processing of placing lights inside of Unreal Engine. This addon let's you place your lights in your scene just like usual but by "Piloting" the light you get to place it just like a camera and once you're done just "Unpilot" from it. You also have the option to customize the usual parameters but I reccommend editing them once you place your lights.
